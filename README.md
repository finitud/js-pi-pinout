Learning RPi+GPIO+node.js
=========================

* Basic HOWTO do stuff with GPIO pins in the Raspberry Pi with nodejs:

http://npmjs.org/package/pi-gpio

_NOTE_ that you have to install an additional package for
`pi-gpio` to work (see link above).

* Connect an LED and a resistor between ground and pin 7
(marked in the board as "#4"), or just change the variable
for whichever pin you are using.

* Have fun!
